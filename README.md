# Spectral-Warping

This Spectral Warping algorithm is adapted from Kathania et.al's study "Data Augmentation Using Spectral Warping for Low Resource Children ASR" (2022). The script does the spectral warping of an audio speech signal. A parameter "alpha" could be changed (from 0.9 to 1.1) to modify spectral position of a speech signal. The script is implemented in Matlab.

The augmented data were further used and tested in our study that focuses on comparison of data augmentation techniques on Filipino ASR on Children Speech.
